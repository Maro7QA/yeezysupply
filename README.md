# Automated test example in Java with Cucumber and Selenium WebDriver #

This project is created to fulfill the Flaconi test automation engineer code challenge.
The test scenario covers the following user journey:

1. user visits https://www.flaconi.de
2. user wants to buy perfume
3. user adds perfume to cart
4. verify perfume is shown on cart page

Bonus Points:
Provide a Dockerfile or container for packaging the necessary dependencies to run the tests.
Create an entrypoint for your Docker container which runs the test.


Test scenario is described in feature file "Add_perfume_to_cart" located here ./src/test/resources/com/automatedtest.
